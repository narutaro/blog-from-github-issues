# What is this?

Github action which creates a blog from your Github issues.

# How it works

* Input is [issues](https://github.com/narutaro/blog-from-github-issues/issues) written in Markdown in the repo. The Github acitions triggers everytime an issue is added, updated, removed.
* Output is `index.html` and `post.html`. The demo is [here](https://narutaro.github.io/blog-from-github-issues/). 


> I like to re-write in other language as:
> 1. Github pages now supports better static file upload
> 2. The code is messy.
